# Idea
 Comparison of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services in terms of configuring CI/CD for a sample application. <br/>
 It is the topic of my Master of Science thesis, and I want to share this knowledge with open source environment.

# Goal
 The main goal is indicate which one cloud provider is best solution for my business case.
 Sample application was emulated, the part of our's microservices infrastructure, that was two applications based on .NET communicatied api-api, and one frontend app based on React.
 It is SIMPLY solution only for example, the implementation is not important part in this case. In this example, we can imagine many solutions for example payments provider, or    any provider in our microservices infrastructure.

# Conditions I will take into account:
* Easy of integration with cloud provider
* Costs
* Stability and general management of cloud resources
